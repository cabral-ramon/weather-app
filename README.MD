This is a weather app created over a couple of days. The app was built using express and express handlebars. It makes a call to the Openweathermap API to fetch a city's weather data and presents the result to the user. Bootstrap was used to build a clean and responsive UI quickly.

The app is live on [heroku](http://gotenki.herokuapp.com/) please note this is hosted on a free heroku account and the site may take up to 10 - 20 seconds to load initially.

To install the app locally, copy or download this repo, run npm install to install all dependencies and npm start to run the app on a local server (you must have node and npm installed on your machine).
